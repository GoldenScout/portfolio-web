        <p id="bio" class="roboto-regular-">Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955),[1] also known as TimBL, is
            an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language,
            the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a
            professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[3][4]

            Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989[5][6] and implemented the first
            successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in
            mid-November.[7][8][9][10][11] He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped
            foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and director of the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith)
            the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
            Sciences.[12][13]

            Berners-Lee is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and
            Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[14] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative
            (WSRI)[15] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[16][17] In
            2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[18] He is a founder and
            president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe.[19] In 2004,
            Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[20][21] He received the 2016 Turing
            Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms
            allowing the Web to scale".[22] He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the
            20th century and has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[23]</p>
